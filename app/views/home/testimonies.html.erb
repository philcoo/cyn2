        <blockquote>Sasha: Amazing. Moist. Delicious. These are all words that come to mind when I eat the cakes and desserts that Cynthia provides. You can tell that she puts a lot of thought and love in her baking. What I enjoy the most is that I can also remind myself that I'm still eating healthy because of the organic ingredients she includes in her baked goods.  </blockquote>

Her homemade icing is literally "to-die-for" it just melts in your mouth and completes you, and with just the right amount of sweetness--perfection. Since she uses all organic ingredients in her cakes, it takes away my guilt when I eat too much.  </blockquote>

It didn't taste like the cakes we usually get from Publix, Walmart, Costco, or even Whole Foods. Her cakes taste uniquely different, just the right amount of sweetness added to the cakes. If your reading this, I highly recommend you to order a cake of your choice. You won't regret it!   </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Ayanna : Cynthia listens to your ideas and then recommends other ideas that will make the cake more colorful and taste better. Her cakes are very creative and tastes better than most store bought cakes because they are made from scratch and it's organic. I've baked and helped deliver cakes with her and I've seen everyone pleased with the results. When I ordered a birthday cake to take to my school she was very helpful with ideas. Everyone at school loved it and wanted her to make their cakes too.                 </blockquote>
